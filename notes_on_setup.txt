1. Install selenium with pip
	python3 -m pip install selenium

2. Install Firefox or Chrome driver
	https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/
	sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/

	Download the most updated driver file and then unzip it into the same folder
	as the .py file you're using selenium with

	I could not get this to work with Chromium, but I was able to make Firefox work
	after I uninstalled the snap package and reinstalled from a .deb package.
		No clue why this works, but it did.
